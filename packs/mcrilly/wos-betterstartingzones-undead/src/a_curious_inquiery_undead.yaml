#      questdescription: |
#        You know, you're actually the first person to ever ask me about my success. No one else seems too interested in the fact I fought for this town, that I helped keep it safe. No one else has asked: why or even HOW!
#
#        I'll tell you what. Prove to me that you're capable of growth, capable of learning, and I'll share with you what I know. There's a book I want. It's in a nearby, abandoned tower. It has records I want to study. Bring me this book and I'll tell you a story that'll change your life forever.

#        Very good. I'm impressed. You even brought it back in one piece.
#
#        *The hero flips through the pages quickly*
#
#        Just as I suspected. Anyway, let's talk about you. You want knowledge? Power? It won't come easy. Well, not too easy. All you have to do is... read. Do a lot of reading and you'll acquire a lot of knowledge. It's as simple as that... oh alright. I'll stop teasing.
#
#        Tomes of Heroic Memories. Have you heard of them? They're terribly rare. I've only ever found two of them. They cannot be picked up or carried, they can only be read there and then on the spot. Very odd little things. After they're read, they seem to disappear, too. That's even odder.
#
#        If you can find these Tomes throughout the land, they will grant you immense experience instantly. Experience so immense it's as if you've lived a whole another lifetime in an instant.
#
#        And that's my little secret: Tomes of Heroic Memories. I found two, read them, and here I am: respected, wise, and powerful.
#
#        Good luck.
